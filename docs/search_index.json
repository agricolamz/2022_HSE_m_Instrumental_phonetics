[["vowel-formants-normalization.html", "6 Vowel formants’ normalization", " 6 Vowel formants’ normalization This section is partially based on (Adank 2003). There are three possible sources of variation in vowel formants measurements (Ladefoged and Broadbent 1957; Pols, Tromp, and Plomp 1973: 1095; Adank 2003): acoustic variation; speaker variation; sociolinguistic; anatomical/physiological variation; and measurement error (“residual variance” in (Pols, Tromp, and Plomp 1973)). There are a lot of researchers aimed to reduce speaker-related variation using acoustic vowel normalization (e. g. (Gerstman 1968; Lobanov 1971; Syrdal and Gopal 1986)). However there are some researches that afraid that normalization procedures can reduce interesting for the linguistics information like sociolinguistic/dialectal signal in data (Hindle 1978; Disner 1980; Thomas 2002, 174–75).
