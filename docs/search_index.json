Speech sounds are complex waves Fourier transform — allows to extract components of the complex wave Larynx produce some sound Vocal tract filter some frequencies 4.1.2 How shape of the vocal tract influences on vowels? Tube model. Historically, height and backness are impressionistic linguistic terms: But we are intersted just in a cardinal points: If we analyze acoustics we can get something like this: i a u F1 300 700 300 F2 2300 1400 800 However, if we analyze real sounds it could be messy: Tube model, after (Fant 1970): vocal tract is a tube or a set of tubes: 4.1.3 Wavelength \\[c = \\frac{\\lambda}{T} = \\lambda\\times f \\approx 33400\\text{ cm/s}\\] c — speed of sound; λ — wavelength; f — sound frequency; T — period. Neutral vocal tract in the position for the vowel ə: Resonance is a phenomenon in which a vibrating system or external force drives another system to oscillate with greater amplitude at specific frequencies. The lowest natural frequency at which such a tube resonates will have a wavelength (λ) four times the length of the tube (L). \\[c = \\frac{\\lambda}{T} = \\lambda\\times f \\approx 33400\\text{ cm/s}\\] The tube also resonates at odd multiples of that frequency. \\[F_1 = \\frac{c}{\\lambda} = \\frac{c}{4 \\times L} \\approx 500 \\text{ Hz}\\] \\[F_2 = \\frac{c}{\\lambda} = \\frac{c}{\\frac{4}{3} \\times L} = \\frac{3 \\times c}{4 L} \\approx 1500 \\text{ Hz}\\] \\[F_3 = \\frac{c}{\\lambda} = \\frac{c}{\\frac{4}{5} \\times L} = \\frac{5 \\times c}{4 L} \\approx 2500 \\text{ Hz}\\] \\[F_n = \\frac{c}{\\lambda} = \\frac{c}{\\frac{4}{n} \\times L} = \\frac{n \\times c}{4 L} \\approx n \\times 500 \\text{ Hz}\\] Something like this we can expect from animals: When there is a constriction, back tube and constriction form Helmholtz resonator. \\[f = \\frac{c}{2\\pi} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{V\\times L}}\\] A — the area of the neck; L — length of the tube; V — volume of the air in the body. 4.1.4 Other models Perturbation Theory [Kajiyama 1941, Mrayati et al. 1988] Quantal Theory (Stevens 1972) Theory of adaptive dispersion (Lindblom and Maddieson 1988) 4.2 Practice References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
