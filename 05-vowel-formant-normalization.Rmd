# Vowel formants' normalization

This section is partially based on [@adank03].

There are three possible sources of variation in vowel formants measurements [@ladefoged57; @pols73: 1095; @adank03]:

* acoustic variation;
* speaker variation;
   * sociolinguistic;
   * anatomical/physiological variation;
* and measurement error ("residual variance" in [@pols73]).

There are a lot of researchers aimed to reduce speaker-related variation using **acoustic vowel normalization** (e. g. [@gerstman68; @lobanov71; @syrdal86]). However there are some researches that afraid that normalization procedures can reduce interesting for the linguistics information like sociolinguistic/dialectal signal in data [@hindle78; @disner80; @thomas02 174--175].
