## Recap

* Sound waves can be described as

$$
s(t) = A \times \cos(2\pi ft + \phi)
$$

  * A — amplitude;
  * f — is the fundamental frequency;
  * φ — phase;
  * t — time.
  
* Speech sounds are complex waves
* Fourier transform --- allows to extract components of the complex wave
* [Larynx produce some sound]()
* [Vocal tract filter some frequencies]()
